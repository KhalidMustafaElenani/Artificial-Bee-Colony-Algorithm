## Description
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. ABC is a population-based metaheuristic for continuous optimization, inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. It leverages self-organization and division of labor to find optimal solutions.

The ABC algorithm operates with three types of bees: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees, each playing a role in exploring and exploiting the solution space. It has been successfully applied to various optimization problems by mimicking the natural behavior of bees.
